<h1>Problem Statement</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly bombarded with information from
    <br/>multiple sources such as meetings, classes, and daily tasks. With so much to keep track of, it
    <br/>can be difficult to remember everything, and important details can easily slip through the
    <br/>cracks. Traditional note-taking methods such as pen and paper or sticky notes can be 
    <br/>inconvenient, disorganized, and easily misplaced. This can lead to frustration and 
    <br/>inefficiency, especially for those who rely on accurate and timely note-taking to 
    <br/>succeed in their personal and professional lives.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    To address this issue, we the Javateers will propose a solution that can solve this issue. This
    <br/>solution will take the form of a note taking app. This app will allow users to easily write down
    <br/>organize information, set reminders, and have a reliable second brain for accessing critical details.
    <br/>This app will not only save you time, but also save you money as the old saying goes, time is money.
