<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Purpose of Product</h3>
<p>The purpose of our product is to allow users to take notes easily with zero to little limitations to how
    users want to jot notes. Anyone should be able to record any information with our product and be able to 
    organize their ideas so that it is easy to go back and review any information. Being able to record complex information
    such as chemical and mathematical formulas should be fast and easy so that students can keep up with a lecture when writing notes. 
</p>
<h3>1.2 Scope of Product</h3>
<p>
    Users should be able to take notes easily. This product is <u>not</u> meant to be a knowledge management platform or a database. 
    This product is designed with students in mind and as such all features are implemented with taking notes during a lecture in mind.
    For example, students sometimes need to record a table of data in their notes. We will have basic table functionality. However, our product
    is not a spreadsheet program so any complex functionality such as a sum of cells, spreadsheet automation, math functions created from a selection of cells,
    etc. are not within the scope of our product.
