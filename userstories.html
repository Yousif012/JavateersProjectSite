    <br/>complex equations into my notes.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>Elaboration: Users should be able to quickly and easily create
    <br/>a wide range of equations and put them in their notes. It should be
    <br/>easy to do to avoid confusion and quick enough that students can keep up
    <br/>while writing notes during a lecture.

<h3>2: Organize notes</h3>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>As a user of the note-taking app, I want to be able to organize my notes 
    <br/>by subject and date so that I can easily find and review my notes.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>Elaboration: The app should allow the user to create and edit subject categories 
    <br/>and assign notes to those categories. The user should also be able to sort notes by date, 
    <br/>both chronologically and reverse-chronologically. The app should provide a visual indication 
    <br/>of which notes have been categorized and which notes are unsorted. The user should also be 
    <br/>able to filter notes by subject and date range.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>Constraints: The app should be intuitive and easy to use, with a minimal learning curve. 
    <br/>The app should not allow the user to create duplicate categories or assign notes to 
    <br/>multiple categories.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>Effort Estimation: 20 person-hours
</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    <br/>Acceptance Test: Create and edit subject categories and assign notes to those categories. 
    <br/>Sort notes by date in both chronological and reverse-chronological order. Check that the 
    <br/>app visually indicates which notes have been categorized and which notes are unsorted. 
    <br/>Filter notes by subject and date range. Ensure that the app does not allow the user to 
    <br/>create duplicate categories or assign notes to multiple categories.
