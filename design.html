<h1>Design Document</h1>

<p>The Note Taking App is an Android application developed using Android Studio, with the purpose of providing users with a convenient and versatile tool to take notes, draw sketches, write mathematical equations in LaTeX, create graphs, and save them in both local device and cloud storage.</p>

<h2>Architecture:</h2>
<p>The app follows the Repository architecture pattern, which separates the data layer from the rest of the application. The data layer consists of a Repository class that communicates with two data sources: a folder of text files for offline storage, and a cloud service (such as Firebase) for online storage.<br/> <img src="./architecture.png" /></p>
  
<h2>Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Text Entry Feature: The app allows users to create, edit, and delete text notes. The user can select the font size, style, and color.</li>
        <li>Drawing Feature: The app allows users to draw sketches using their fingers or a stylus. The user can select the pen size, color, and opacity.</li>
        <li>LaTeX Feature: The app allows users to write mathematical equations in LaTeX. The user can insert symbols, fractions, superscripts, subscripts, and more.</li>
        <li>Graphing Feature: The app allows users to create graphs by selecting from a variety of chart types (such as line, bar, or pie) and entering data values.</li>
        <li>Auto-save Feature: The app automatically saves changes made to notes, sketches, equations, and graphs.</li>
        <li>Storage Feature: The app stores notes, sketches, equations, and graphs in both local device and cloud storage. The user can select the desired storage option.</li>
        <li>Authentication Feature: The app has an authentication system that enables users to access their data with a special User Key. The user can log in to their account using their email address and password. Once logged in, the user can access their data with a special User Key that is generated by the app.</li>
      </ul>
<h2>User Interface:</h2>     
<p>The app will have a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and use all of the features. The interface will include a main screen that displays a list of all notes, as well as buttons for creating new notes, accessing the drawing and graphing features, and inserting Latex equations.</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements:</h2>
<p>The app will be developed using Android Studio and will target Android devices running Android 5.0 or higher. The app will use Java as the programming language and will utilize the Android SDK and various libraries to provide the desired functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, this note-taking app will be a useful tool for users who need to take notes, create sketches and diagrams, and insert mathematical equations and graphs into their work. The app will be easy to use and will provide a range of features that will make it a valuable tool for students, professionals, and anyone else who needs to take notes on the go.</p>
